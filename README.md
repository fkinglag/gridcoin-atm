# gridcoin-atm readme
Free and open source project collaboration for the development of software and design of a Gridcoin ATM.

# Quick FAQ/todo:

Does this have to be local?
No.

Is it legal to just set one of those up?
Yes, should be. Depends on where you live and whether or not you have permission among other things.

Will there be plans for proprietary distribution of this software?
No.

Are you going to consider security?
Yes, and security will especially be more of a focus later as this progresses.

How about a wiki?
Yes, there will be a wiki and documentation.

Any plans on having a website?
No.

Is there anywhere else that discussion is happening?
No, however, you can join https://t.me/localgridcoins for chats related to current or past development. Later I will add a link to a new thread on crypto currency talk Gridcoin forum.

Please, feel free to inquire about anything else there on telegram. Or in #gridcoin on snoonet, efnet or freenode. I, fkinglag, will try to update this repo with more information as the starting process all happens to come together.
